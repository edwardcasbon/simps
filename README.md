# Simps

Simps is a **simple** and **easy** to use **PHP MVC framework** with database connection handling and view templating built in.

With Simps you can be building web sites and applications within minutes rather than hours.

## Usage - 5 simple steps

1. If you're wanting to use a database connection, add those details into the config (/app/config/app.config)
2. Put your controllers in the controllers directory (/app/modules/default/controllers/) and make sure they extend the 'Simps_Controller' base class.
3. Put your models/classes in the models directory (/app/modules/default/models)
4. Put your template layout in the layouts directory (/app/modules/default/views/layouts) and update the config (/app/config/app.config) accordingly.
5. Put your template scripts in the scripts directory (/app/modules/default/views/scripts/{controller})

Now open it up in the browser, it's really as easy as that.

Simps has been developed and tested with PHP 5.2.17 and newer. It may also work with previous versions.
