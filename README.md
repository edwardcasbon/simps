# Simps

Simps is a **simple** and **easy** to use **PHP MVC framework** with database connection and view templating built in.

With Simps you can be building web sites and applications within minutes rather than hours.

## Usage - 5 simple steps

1. If you're wanting to use a database connection, add those details into the config (/app/config/app.config)
2. Put your controllers in the controllers directory (/app/controllers/) and make sure they extend the 'Simps_Controller' base class.
3. Put your models/classes in the models directory (/app/models)
4. Put your template layout in the layouts directory (/app/views/layouts) and update the config (/app/config/app.config) accordingly.
5. Put your template scripts in the scripts directory (/app/views/scripts/{controller})

Now open it up in the browser, it's really as easy as that.
